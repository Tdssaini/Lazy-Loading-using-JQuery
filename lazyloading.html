			Hello everyone. Recently i came across one requirement where we need to have Auto Complete functionality in Visualforce Page so i used apex:inputText component with list attribute and that renders the List of Objects as dropdown as well as Auto Complete.  But due to some limitations with apex:inputText and i planned to use JQuery's Autocomplete functionality and thats works great with Salesforce. So i though of sharing that implementation with you guys.

For AutoComplete functionality i have created one AutoComplete Component that we can use in any VisualForce Page and we can easily read data from AutoComplete component in our VisualForce page using JavaScript. In AutoComplete component i have created VisualForce Component and VisualForce Controller. In VisualForce Component i have used JQuery CSS & JS Files that i have upload in Static Resource.
